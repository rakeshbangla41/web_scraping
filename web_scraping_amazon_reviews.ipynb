       "\"this laptop is perfect for home and student use don't get blindsided by the negative reviews the item arrives in sturdy packaging which prevents it from damage during transit i myself use this laptop for university online meetings this laptop is not meant for high graphics gaming, low-resolution games are compatible rest assured is finebenefits:- heat: no heating issue while charging only the charging adapter and battery gets warm which is quite normal- charging time: gets charged in 2hr 30mn (0-100) playback time (normal usage)- 4 hrs- boot time: 10 secs switch-on & switch-off- writing speed: usb 30 (output to input) gives 80-120 mbps writing speed- display: fhd display, antiglare display lets you stream netflix, youtube & many more from any angle of the laptop- sound: based on a laptop system, the sound is quite good i hear music at volume 40/100- touchpad: smooth- pre-activated office 2019note:- purchase a saco silicon keyboard cover (black) as the visibility of the default key prints in daylight are not so efficiently visible- as shown in picture, the laptop must be kept above any plain hard surface so that the air circulation keeps running and does not gets heated- in many reviews, you will find that the laptop is getting heated, the worst laptop and all but one must know how to use it properly- at first, i was thinking of purchasing the same model only with ryzen 3 4300u processor but i changed my decision and stuck to this only because as compared to 4300u, in this laptop 3250u one gets 156 screen, rj-45 port, 1tb hdd, calculator keyboard- don't confuse yourself with the processors, someone will say quad-core is better than dual-core, and don't purchase this laptop as it is dual-core but trust me for home and student basic usage, this laptop is more than enough- if one plays a game or performs multi-high tasking software, then the laptop fan runs at high speed which is a bit noisy but don't worry its normal only- ddr4 2400 mghz is sufficient for a student and basic office meetings use- do check the warranty on hp's official website by entering the serial number which is present at the laptop base or product boxthat's all folks!!!\""
