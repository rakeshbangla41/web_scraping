## Web Scraping

The first step in the Data Analytics pipeline is to get the required data for analysis. The data could be available in the database or as Excel/CSV files. If the data is available in the above-said formats, we could fetch/import the data and proceed further. But, if the required data is not available, we have to acquire data from other sources. The required data could be available from various websites on the internet.   

Web Scraping is one such technique that is used to extract data from the internet. In this project, I have scraped data from the internet using a Python library called “Beautiful Soup”. It is used for parsing HTML files and then extracting the required data.

In this project, I have scraped data from two websites:
1) IMDB - Top 250 Movies  
2) Amazon - HP Laptop 15s Reviews

I have uploaded the related Python Notebooks (.ipynb files)
